Registers
=========

                        | 64 bit    | 32 bit      | 16 bit      | 8 bit
=============================================================================
General purpose:        |           |             |             |
A (accumulator)         | RAX       | EAX         | AX          | AL
B (base, addressing)    | RBX       | EBX         | BX          | BL
C (counter, iterations) | RCX       | ECX         | CX          | CL
D (data)                | RDX       | EDX         | DX          | DL
=============================================================================
Stack:                  |           |             |             |
Stack pointer           | RSP       | ESP         | SP          | SPL
Frame pointer           | RBP       | EBP         | BP          | BPL
=============================================================================
Other:                  |           |             |             |
                        | RDI       | EDI         | DI          | DIL
                        | RSI       | ESI         | SI          | SIL
=============================================================================
                        | R0 .. R15 | R0D .. R15D | R0W .. R15W | R0B .. R15B

As well as XMM0 .. XMM15 for 128 bit floating point numbers.


Calling C
=========

Put function arguments (first to last) in the following registers (64 bit representations):
RDI, RSI, RDX, RCX, R8, R9, then push to stack (in reverse, has to be cleaned up by the caller!)
XMM0 - XMM7 for floats

Return values are stored in RAX (int) or XMM0 (float)

RBP, RBX, R12, R13, R14, R15 will not be changed by the called function, all others may be

Align stack pointer (RSP..) to 16 byte, calling pushes 8 bytes!

Keep in mind that strings (in C) are 0-terminated

Like in a normal C program, the label that is (de facto) called first is "main", with the args
argc (argcount) in RDI, and the char** argvec in RSI (the commandline arguments as in C's main function).

Data
====

8 bit: ............ db
16 bit: ........... dw
32 bit: ........... dd
64 bit: ........... ddq/do
float: ............ dd 
double: ........... dq
extended precision: dt


Conditionals
============

cmp op1, op2 -> mimics 'sub op1, op2' but only changes the zero and carry flag for comparing.

Prefixes:
j~ x        -> jump to x if ~
cmov~ x, y  -> conditional mov x, y if ~
setc~ x     -> set x to 1 if ~, x is 8 bit reg

Many suffixes, including:
a (above, >), ae (above or equal, >=), b (below, <), be (below or equal, <=), e (equal, =), ne (not equal, !=)


Program structure
=================

global <entry> -> exposes entry point
extern <function> -> declares a function in another linked .o file (e.g. C function, other asm file)

section <sectiontype> -> sets section, usually:
.text -> program code
.data -> data

The program entry point of a standalone program is the label "_start".
When compiled with gcc, C provides "_start", which inits and then jumps to "main",
which should then be implemented by the program.


Syscalls
========

- put syscall number in EAX (e.g. 60 for exit, 1 for write to stdout)
- put arguments in the registers (see above) like when calling a C function
- execute the 'syscall' command


Compile
=======

'nasm -felf64 [ASM]'
After that:
without gcc: 'ld -o [OUTPUT] [OBJECT]'
with gcc:    'gcc -o [OUTPUT] [OBJECT]'
